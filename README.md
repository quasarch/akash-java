## Release Notes ##

Changes are tracked in [Change log file](CHANGELOG.md)

## Getting Started

### Example
A way of getting started might be to have a look at the example folder. In there you will find 
an example project which makes use of the operations supported by this library.  
For instance, to get a bid one would write code similar to what can be found in GetBid.java:

```java
public class GetBid {
    ///...
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var akash = ExampleHelper.getClient();
        var result = akash.getBid(owner, deploymentSequence, null, null, providerId);
        if (result.isLeft()) {
            log.info("Invocation failed, error is: " + result.getLeft());
            System.exit(0);
        }
        log.info("fetched bid: {}", result.get());
    }
}
```

### Dependencies
To import the library using maven, please add to your pom.xml:

```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/cloud.quasarch/akash-java -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>cloud.quasarch</groupId>
    <artifactId>akash-java</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>

```
